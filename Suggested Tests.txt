There are functionally 3 subjects within the framework of the the AFT. An air traffic controller,a plane user, and an administrator.

Suggested Tests

-User Login. Ensure that users have to login into a website, or sign up with an account.

-User Sign Up Security. Only users who are designated by the administrator are allowed to sign up for an account. This process needs to be authenicated in some way.
The login for user sign in must also be secure in some way

-User Login Security. Two Way authentication should be used for logins.

-At the current stage we can implement a basic login system, and implement security measures later

More test should be developed for other scenarios
